Frontend created using React (typescript version). Uses types that are declared on the backend. It allows you to send queries to the backend that allows you to fetch, create, delete and edit records. If I wanted to develop the application, I would take care of its RWD and improve UX-related functionalities (for example two-stage record deletion, more interesting interface, adding dynamic effects).
